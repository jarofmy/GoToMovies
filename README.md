Autolayout checked to fit on all available testing screens, along with landscape view.

Everything should be working according to the listed guidelines.

Attempted to implement the extra-credit "Pull to Refresh" function by utilizing iOS's builtin UIRefreshControl(), I believe it only half-works. It'll refresh when pulled, and display a refresh/spinning wheel. It will also call the function to make the same request query. However, I was not able to get the .endRefreshing() function to work. So after refreshing, the wheel stays displayed/stuck on the screen.
